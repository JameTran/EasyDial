# EasyDial
An automated dialing device designed to fit a home telephone, and manually dial numbers using solenoids.

This device was built for a client with cerebral palsy who wished to continue using their own personal home phone. However, due to
their illness, they no longer had the dexterity required to press the buttons on their phone. My team and I instead designed a mechanical
autodialer that would fit on their phone, as well as a remote that would fit on to their wheelchair. With the press of a button, the 
autodialer would dial a preprogrammed sequence of numbers. This functioned as a sort of "mechanical speedialer", and allowed 
the client to keep in touch with their family and friends with just one button.
